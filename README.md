# ShopAssistant
This is my Android project

The Application's purpose is to help a user get his wanted products. The user creates a shopping list and when he is close to a shop that sells one of his wanted products the application notifies him.

The products and shops are stored in a local database for the moment. The database can be moved on a server and all requests made to it, but at a later version.
The list of products (names, prices, images) is build by a Python script.

## Some images to show features of the app:
The Main Screen is the place where you can see your favourite products and categories, as well as search for new ones:

The Settings Screen is a little thin right now, you can only choose weather to be notified or not when close to a shop that sells your product:
